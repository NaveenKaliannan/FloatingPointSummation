# FloatingPointSummation

Algorithm for comparing the error and time performances of the floating point summation methods (Normal, Pairwise and Kahan summations). Below figures shows the error and time comparison for the 3 summation methods. Kahan summation significantly reduces the error compared to the Normal and Pairwise summation methods. But less exponent and mantissa shifting make the Pairwise summation method faster and computationally cheaper.
