# FloatingPointSummation

Algorithm for comparing the error and time performances of the floating point summation methods (Normal, Pairwise and Kahan summations). Kahan summation method significantly reduces the error compared to the Normal and Pairwise summation methods. But Pairwise summation method is faster, computationally cheap, less mantissa and exponent shifting.
